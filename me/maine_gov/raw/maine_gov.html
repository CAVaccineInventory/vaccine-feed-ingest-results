<p>You may hear directly from your health care provider about getting a vaccine, or you may contact the locations below for an appointment. Many locations are also offering drop-in vaccinations with no appointment necessary.</p>

<p>If you need help scheduling an appointment,<strong> </strong>or want to know if a site near you is offering vaccinations without an appointment,<strong> call the Maine COVID-19 Community Vaccination Line at 1-888-445-4111.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;There is no charge for the COVID-19 vaccine, but you should be prepared to provide any insurance information and proof of eligibility at the vaccination site.</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">What about the second dose?</h2>

<p>The Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine requires two doses. When scheduling your second dose, it is recommended that you make an appointment with the same vaccination site whenever possible and follow their process for signing up for dose two.</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">Vaccine locations in Maine</h2>

<p>The following locations are now accepting appointments for eligible Maine residents<strong>. </strong> <strong>Appointment availability is dependent on vaccine supply. </strong>These listings are subject to change and will be updated regularly.</p>
